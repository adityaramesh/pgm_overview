## Introduction

This repository contains the source for a series of slides that serve as an
overview of graphical models. Currently, they provide a discourse on the
representation of graphical models, including the factorization and independence
properties of directed, undirected, and partially directed graphical models. The
slides borrow or directly incorporate material from Daphne Koller and Nir
Friedman's
[book](http://www.amazon.com/Probabilistic-Graphical-Models-Principles-Computation/dp/0262013193)
on Probabilistic Graphical Models, as well as from David Sontag's [lecture
slides](http://cs.nyu.edu/~dsontag/courses/pgm12/). I highly recommend that you
read the original sources, especially if you find these slides to be useful. The
diagrams found in these slides are produced inline, within the LaTeX sources,
using PGF and TikZ. If you find these slides useful or have any comments or
suggestions about improvements that should be made, feel free to email me.
Alternatively, you can also submit a pull request to incorporate the changes
directly.
